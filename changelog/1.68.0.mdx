# Release 1.68.0

This release includes one major new feature.

**London Studios SmartSigns Support**

This **requires** the latest release of the [`sna-live-map`](https://github.com/SnailyCAD/live-map/releases) resource.
This allows dispatchers to view all SmartSigns and allows dispatchers with the `Manage Smart Signs` permission to edit SmartSigns directly on the Dispatch Live Map.

**Performance Fixes**

This release also includes a few minor performance fixes for the live-map.
